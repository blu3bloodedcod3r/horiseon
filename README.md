# <Horiseon Wk 1 Challenge>

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation for this project was to get comfortable with the use of HTML, CSS and the git repositories further than what I had learned on my own.
- This project was built because the initial HTML elements were cleaned up to become more descriptive and to remove the styling from the HTML file. The CSS file was condensed to be easier to read.
- This solves the problem of each section being a <div> in the HTML file to more descripted <section>s.
- I learned that it is much easier to read a CSS file when sections are grouped together for the same styling methods. In the HTML file, I learned that using <div>s can be hard to read, especially in a much larger file. When <section> is used, it looks cleaner and can be much easilier to read when the attribute has an id or class.
